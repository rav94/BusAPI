    <h2> Getting Started</h2>
    <h3 id="welcome"> Introduction</h3>
    <p> Are you listening to your customers?</p>

    <p> As they say: You cannot improve what you cannot measure; but the paradox is you
        cannot measure everything – happiness, hatred, anger… but you can measure customer
        satisfaction. Yes, you can measure customer satisfaction by analyzing likes and
        dislikes of your customers. You can gauge popularity of your website or products.
        You can also:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>See how many visitors like the new design of your website or logo</li>
        <li>Analyze what your readers want to see on your blog</li>
        <li>Understand how helpful the content on your support forum or website is</li>
        <li>Know the latest trends and user’s opinion before launching a new product or service</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Opineo allows you to do all of this and much more without signing up for an account
        or hire an expert. This DIY tool enables you to listen to your customers’ voice
        easily and instantly. All you have to do is go online, design your widget and place
        it on your website. </p>
